# My NixOS Config

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not use this configuration unless you want to suffer though my lack of knowledge of Nix (the language) and NixOS. This config is likely poorly designed and can be significantly improved

| Type           | Program      |
| :------------- | :----------: |
| Editor         | [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs)/[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) |
| DE             | [KDE Plasma 6](https://www.kde.org/plasma-desktop) |
| Shell          | [ZSH](https://www.zsh.org/) |
| Browser        | [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) |

As of now, I am using plasma6.

I used this [starter config](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs).

## Todo
- [ ] Rewrite config to use hosts structure
- [ ] Rewrite to use modules based config
